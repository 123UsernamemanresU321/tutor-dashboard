5.1 The standard rate is [Rxxx] per [60/90]-minute Session ("Standard Rate"), unless otherwise agreed in Writing.

5.2 The Guardian may offer packages (e.g. [x]-Session blocks) at agreed rates. Details of any package and its price will be shared in Writing.

6.3 If the Client cancels or reschedules with less than 24 hours' notice, or the Student fails to attend ("no-show"):

12.5 The Client may request access to, or correction of, Personal Information held by the Guardian, subject to reasonable written request.

12.6 The Guardian will take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect Personal Information but cannot guarantee absolute security of data transmitted over the internet.
13. CONFIDENTIALITY & INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
13.1 The Guardian and Minor Tutor will keep all information about the Student's academic performance and personal circumstances confidential, except:
- Where disclosure is required by law; or

without the Guardian's prior written consent.

15. GROUP LESSONS (IF APPLICABLE)
15.1 If the Student is part of a group Session:
- Fees may be charged per Student or per group, as set out in Writing;

16.1 The Guardian will not use the Student's full name, photo, or identifiable work in any public marketing without the Client's explicit written consent.

16.3 Granting or refusing consent for such use will not affect the Services provided.
17. RATE CHANGES

17.2 Any change in Fees will be communicated to the Client in Writing with at least [30] days' notice.

18. FORCE MAJEURE
18.1 Neither Party will be liable for failure or delay in performing obligations under this Agreement (other than payment obligations) where such failure or delay is caused by events beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to:
- Natural disasters, war, unrest, or pandemics;
- Government restrictions;
- Widespread power or communication failures;
- Serious illness or injury.

18.2 In such cases, the affected obligations will be suspended for the duration of the force majeure event, and the Parties will work in good faith to reschedule missed Sessions where possible.
19. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
19.1 The Guardian and Minor Tutor will provide Services with reasonable care and skill but do not guarantee any particular academic result or outcome.

19.2 To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Guardian's total liability arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (whether in contract, delict, or otherwise) is limited to the total Fees actually paid by the Client to the Guardian in the 3 months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

25. SYSTEM STATUS & STUDENT DASHBOARD VALIDITY
25.1 The Student's online dashboard and account may display a status of "INVALID - CONTRACT NOT SIGNED" until this Agreement has been accepted and electronically signed by the Client.

25.2 The Guardian and Minor Tutor are not obliged to begin tutoring, schedule lessons, provide materials, or maintain bookings while the Student's status is INVALID.

    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <div class="muted">Last Updated: 28 November 2025</div>
    <p>These Terms of Service govern your use of the tutoring dashboard (“the Dashboard”) and the private tutoring services provided through it. By using the Dashboard, you agree to these terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be a student I tutor or have booked tutoring sessions with me. If you are under 18, a parent/guardian must approve your participation.</p>

    <h2>2. Your Account</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for keeping your login details private, using your account only for school-related tutoring purposes, and informing me immediately if you notice unauthorized access. I may suspend or delete accounts used improperly.</p>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You must not attempt to hack, modify, or damage the Dashboard; share screenshots or data from other students’ pages; upload harmful files, scripts, or viruses; or misuse any private information stored on the platform. Misuse may result in account suspension.</p>

    <h2>4. Tutoring Sessions</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Booking & Attendance</h3>
    <p>You agree to attend sessions you have booked and provide reasonable notice if you need to cancel or reschedule.</p>
    <h3>4.2 Cancellations</h3>
    <p>If you cancel too late, you may still be charged for the session. All cancellation rules will be communicated clearly when booking.</p>

    <h2>5. Payments & Invoices</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Invoice Access</h3>
    <p>Invoices are displayed on your dashboard for transparency.</p>
    <h3>5.2 Payment Obligations</h3>
    <p>By attending lessons, you agree to pay the invoice amounts before or on the due date using the agreed payment method.</p>
    <h3>5.3 Late Payments</h3>
    <p>Repeated late payments may result in suspension of lessons or late fees (if applicable).</p>

    <h2>6. Resources & Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All study notes, worksheets, videos, explanations, and materials on the Dashboard are for your personal academic use only. You may not repost, sell, redistribute, or claim them as your own work.</p>

    <h2>7. Privacy & Data</h2>
    <p>All information is handled according to the Privacy Policy. By using the Dashboard, you agree to those data-handling practices.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitations of Liability</h2>
    <p>I strive to ensure the Dashboard is reliable and accurate. However, I am not responsible for internet outages, third-party platform downtime (e.g., Supabase), loss of data caused by your device, or academic outcomes. The Dashboard is provided “as is,” without warranties.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>I may terminate or restrict access if you violate these Terms, misuse the system or another student’s information, or stop lessons and no longer need the Dashboard. You may delete your account at any time.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Principles</h2>
    <p>These terms follow common international standards for private tutoring services and student data handling and are not tied to any specific legal jurisdiction.</p>
